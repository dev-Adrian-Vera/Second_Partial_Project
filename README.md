 # Second Partial Project of the subject "PROCESOS DE SOFTWARE".
 ## Developers: Adrian Vera, Lina Sanches, Angelo Rubio.
 
This project consists of reusing an abandoned project and making the necessary corrections to make it possible to execute it.

This project is an updated version of the developer's draft @pavelgonchar. if you wish to obtain the code without adapting, follow this link: https://github.com/pavelgonchar/color-independent-style-transfer.
 
# Style-independent color transfer software.

### Color transfer information.

click on this link (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.00756.pdf) to get information on the subject.

# Requirements.
- You need search two images that have the same dimension, if you ignore this step the program will show an exception.
- You must enter the dimension of your images manualmente. 
- Tensorflow since version 1.15.0.

# Examples.
### These two images are sent to the program.
